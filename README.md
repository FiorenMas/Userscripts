#### :question: Read [This](https://github.com/FiorenMas/Userscripts/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md) to find out why you should compile Userscripts.

#### :exclamation: I have tested the userscript below and it seems to be working properly. However, I am uncertain if it might still have some hidden bugs.

#### :warning: If you encounter errors, please reinstall the original version before reporting bugs to authors.

#### :thumbsup: If you have any userscripts you're interested in, please let me know. I've also reviewed some userscripts that don't seem to be working, and you can list those [Here](https://github.com/FiorenMas/Userscripts/blob/main/Not%20work)
